		<h1>NRT Portfolio Brief </h1>
		<p> NRT Portfolio is designed to display the work of Nadia Rendon Talavera. This will include work ranging from her professional experience and her undergrad and graduate education. </p>
 
	<div>
		<h2> Project Purpose </h2>
		<h3> Business Needs </h3>
		<p> The business needs that drive this project are to serve as a source of proof points for potential employers, as well as lead generation for new clients. If the aforementioned needs are met successfully, then the business will be impacted in the following ways: increased brand awareness, increase in engagement, and increase in conversions </p>
 
		<h3> Use Cases </h3>
		<p> This product exists for two reasons. First, to help other businesses solve their digital marketing (particularly social or multicultural marketing) needs, and to provide a complementary platform to vet the portfolio owner through work examples. Essentially this project helps solve use cases that revolve around obtaining specific sets of information and contacting the portfolio owner. </p>

	<div>
		<h2> Stakeholders and Users </h2>
		<h3> Stakeholders </h3>
		<p> The stakeholder is the portfolio/business owner, in addition to the end-users. There are no current sponsors except the business owner themselves
		<h3> Target Users </h3>
		<p> When it comes to end-users, this project will specifically target recruiters or HR workers at agencies, media companies, or in-house marketing teams. 
	</div>
 
	<div>
		<h2> Project Requirements </h2> 		<p> Simplicity of design and navigation, accessibility of inormation and messaging, relatability to client and relevancy of client work. </p>
	</div>
 
	<div>
		<h2> Success measures  </h2>
		<h3> Independent Business Owners </h3>
		<p> There are two main ways the client measures success. The first is through lead generation of independent clients. This is the primary and most direct way the product makes money; however, not every potential client is a correct fit which is why conversion through submission forms is the primary KPI for the website. </p>
		<h3> Recruiters and Marketing Staff </h3>
		<p> Second, success pertaining to employment seeking opportunities will be measured through user satisfaction. What does this look like? User satisfaction will be determined through bounce rates, retention rates, and time on site/page rates. 
		<p> The levers that influence whether the product is profitable for both target audiences include page readability, navigation based on respective customer journeys, ease of access to information, as well as clear CTA’s. </p> 
	</div>
 
	<div>
		<h2> Other Considerations </h2>
		<h3>  Competitors </h3>
		<p> 9th Wonder Agency is a potential competitor, particularly since they offer culturally aware creative services. This competitor might not be a direct competitor since it is an agency and not within the individual/freelancer realm. This, however, may act as a weakness for potential clients with smaller budgets or who are looking for a more intimate working relationship. On the other hand, one strength this agency has is that they have entire teams to produce or work on larger projects with bigger scopes that a freelancer may not be able to fully handle on their own. </p>
	</div>
	 	<div>
		<h3>  Risks </h3>
		<p> The primary red flag for this project is ensuring that the website efficiently solves both target users’ needs without extending or over complicating the scope of the project. While this shouldn’t be a major issue design wise, since they have similar needs, the end goals for each target user may conflict with each other and cause issues when it comes to the potential client’s/employer’s consideration of the portfolio owner. </p>
